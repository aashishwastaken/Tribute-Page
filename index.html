        <strong>January 30, 1948</strong> - Gandhi is approached by Nathuram Vinayuk Godse, a Hindu nationalist.

    <div id="letter1">Respected Mr. Gandhi <br>

I use the presence of your friend in our home to send you these lines. You have shown through your works, that it is possible to succeed without violence even with those who have not discarded the method of violence. We may hope that your example will spread beyond the borders of your country, and will help to establish an international authority, respected by all, that will take decisions and replace war conflicts.
<br>
With sincere admiration,
<br>
Yours
<br>
(Signed, ‘A. Einstein’)
<br>
I hope that I will be able to meet you face to face some day.</div>

DEAR FRIEND,
<br>
I was delighted to have your beautiful letter sent through Sundaram. It is a great consolation to me that the work I am doing finds favour in your sight. I do indeed wish that we could meet face to face and that too in India at my Ashram.
<br>
Yours sincerely,
<br>
(Signed, ‘M. K. Gandhi’)</div>
